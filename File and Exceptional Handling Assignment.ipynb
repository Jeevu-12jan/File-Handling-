    "\n",
    "Ans. Multithraeding is More efficient than multiprocessing for tasks within a single process.threads share a common address space, which is memory-efficient. Whereas, Multithreading  Increases computing power by utilizing multiple processors.Suitable for tasks that require heavy computational power.Examples of multithreading is downloading,managing multiple tasks on browser whereas multiproceesing is having the use oof i.e. Compuation, Server handling, multiple request simultaneously.\n"

    "Ans.Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time.\n",
    "Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently.\n",
    "The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Multiprocessing:\n",
    "Improved Performance: By running multiple processes parallely , each on its own processor or core, multiprocessing can significantly reduce the time required for executing tasks.\n",
    "Avoiding GIL Limitations: Unlike threading, multiprocessing does not suffer from Python’s GIL issues because each process runs in its own Python interpreter.\n",
    "Better Resource Utilization: It allows for the effective utilization of multiple CPUs within a machine, which can lead to better handling of resource-intensive tasks.\n",
